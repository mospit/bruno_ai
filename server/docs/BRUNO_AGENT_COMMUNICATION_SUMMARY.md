```

```

## 🤝 Agent Communication Architecture

### 1. **Master Agent Coordination**
The Bruno Master Agent acts as the central orchestrator:

```python
async def orchestrate_meal_planning(self, request_analysis):
    # Step 1: Parallel execution of budget analysis and nutrition requirements
    budget_task = {...}
    nutrition_task = {...}
    parallel_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        self._delegate_to_agent("budget_analyst_agent", budget_task),
        self._delegate_to_agent("nutrition_guide_agent", nutrition_task)
    ])
    
    # Step 2: Recipe optimization based on gathered data
    recipe_result = await self._delegate_to_agent("recipe_chef_agent", recipe_task)
    
    # Step 3: Shopping list optimization
    shopping_result = await self._delegate_to_agent("instacart_integration_agent", shopping_task)
    
    # Step 4: Generate Bruno's personalized response
    return await self._generate_bruno_response(...)
```

### 2. **A2A Gateway with Circuit Breakers**
Enhanced gateway ensures reliable communication:

```python
class BrunoA2AGatewayV2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.circuit_breakers = {}
        self.load_balancer = LoadBalancer()
        
    async def create_task(self, agent_name: str, task_data: TaskRequest):
        # Check circuit breaker
        if not self.circuit_breakers[agent_name].can_execute():
            raise HTTPException(503, "Agent temporarily unavailable")
            
        # Execute with retry logic and metrics
        return await self._execute_with_resilience(agent_name, task_data)
```

### 3. **Personality Bridge Integration**
Ensures all agent responses maintain Bruno's voice:

```python
from agents.v2.bruno_personality_bridge import enhance_agent_response

# In any agent response:
agent_response = "Your budget analysis is complete."
bruno_response = enhance_agent_response(
    agent_response, 
    {"budget_success": savings > 0}
)
# Result: "Bada-bing! Ya budget analysis is complete - saved ya some dough!"
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. **Base Agent Enhancement**
All agents inherit Bruno's personality through the enhanced base agent:

```python
def _build_prompt(self, prompt: str, context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> str:
    agent_context = f"""
    You are Bruno, a savvy New York foodie bear from Brooklyn who helps families eat like kings on working family budgets.
    
    BRUNO'S CORE IDENTITY:
    - Born and raised in Brooklyn where every dollar counted
    - Ma taught you how to stretch grocery budgets while putting love on the table
    [... full personality definition ...]

    [... complete response guidelines ...]
    """
```

### 2. **Agent-Specific Enhancements**
Each specialized agent has personality-specific adaptations:

```python
# Budget Analyst Agent
async def _generate_budget_recommendations(self, budget, feasibility_score, opportunities):
    recommendations = []
    
    if feasibility_score < 0.6:
        recommendations.append(f"Listen, ya budget's a bit tight at ${budget:.0f}. Bruno suggests bumpin' it up by ${(0.6 - feasibility_score) * budget:.0f} so ya family can eat healthier. Trust me on this one!")
    
    if feasibility_score > 0.9:
        recommendations.append("Bada-bing! Ya got a sweet budget that'll let ya go for the good stuff - organic, fancy cuts, the works. Ya family's gonna eat like royalty!")
```

### 3. **Personality Bridge Validation**
Continuous validation ensures personality consistency:

```python
def validate_personality_consistency(self, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    results = {
        "has_brooklyn_accent": False,
        "has_signature_phrases": False,
        "has_family_warmth": False,
        "personality_score": 0.0,
        "suggestions": []
    }
    
    # Check for Brooklyn accent markers
    accent_count = sum(1 for marker in self.bruno_traits["accent_markers"] if marker in message.lower())
    results["has_brooklyn_accent"] = accent_count > 0
    
    # Generate improvement suggestions if needed
    if results["personality_score"] < 0.3:
        results["suggestions"].append("Message needs more Bruno personality - consider complete rewrite")
