# Bruno AI Project Context

## Project Overview

Bruno AI is an innovative AI-powered food budget planning application that combines multi-agent architecture with real-time grocery pricing to help families eat well within their budget constraints. The project features Bruno, a friendly AI bear mascot who serves as a personal meal planning assistant.

**"Hey Bruno, plan meals for $75 this week"** - Bruno AI creates personalized meal plans that fit exact budget limits using real grocery prices and provides seamless Instacart integration for one-click shopping.

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The project implements Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol with four specialized agents:

1. **Bruno Master Agent** - Central orchestrator and user interface
2. **Grocery Browser Agent** - Real-time price discovery and comparison
3. **Recipe Chef Agent** - Meal planning and recipe optimization  
4. **Instacart API Agent** - Product search and order management

### Technology Stack

- Framework: FastAPI with async support
- AI: Google Gemini API (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Multi-Agent: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) with A2A Protocol
- Web Scraping: Selenium WebDriver for real-time pricing
- Data Processing: Pandas, Pydantic
- Testing: Pytest with comprehensive test suites
- Integration: Instacart API for grocery ordering

**Frontend (Flutter)**
- Framework: Flutter with Dart
- UI: Material Design with custom Bruno branding
- State Management: Provider pattern
- Platform: Cross-platform (iOS & Android)
